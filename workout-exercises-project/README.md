## 1. About the Project

**Workout-Exercises** is an e-commerce project which allow people to share exercises with others.

### 2. What can users do?

After a successful login/register, every user can explore the exercise catalog and see the details for all the exerecises that have been created by other users by navigating through the Search and Drop-Down menus. Users can also create exercises and can navigate to a page where they can see their creations. They can Edit/Delete only their exercises. Users are not allowed to enter any URLs purposed to be used from the admin.

### 3 What can admin do?

Unlike the userâ€™s opportunities, admins have a lot more control over the site. They have a regular user's functionality as well as access to the Admin Panel Page from where they can Edit/Delete all other users. Admins can also Edit/Delete other users' exercises.

## 4. Public Part

Non-registered users are redirected to Login-page from which they can navigate to a Register-Page if they don't have an account or see the About page of the website.


## 5. UI & UX

This project is designed with `bootstrap` - more information on it can be found at: https://getbootstrap.com/.

Any suggestions for improving the project idea and functionality would be gladly discussed. Star the repository if you find it useful.
