## 7. About the Project

**_Workout-Exercises_** is an e-commerce project which allows people to share exercises with others.


### 7.2 What can users do?

After a successful login/register, every user can explore the site catalog by using a Search and a Drop-Down menu and see the details for the different exercises that the other users have created. They can create exercises of their own and see a list
of only their exercises. Users can also Edit/Delete their own exercises.

### 7.3 What can admin do?

Unlike the userâ€™s opportunities, admins have a lot more control over the site. Every admin can Create and Edit exercises and also Edit/Delete the exercises of all of the users.
 They also have the opportunity to Edit/Delete all the other users.

## 8. Public Part

Only authenticated users can explore the exercise list so if you are not you will be redirected to the login page with an option to create an account if you don't already have.

## 10. UI
